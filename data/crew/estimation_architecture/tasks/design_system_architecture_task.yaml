task:
  name: "Design_System_Architecture"
  description: |
                Acts as a Principal Architect. You will analyze the Product Backlog and produce a system-level architectural blueprint.
                
                input:
                  1. product_backlog: {product_backlog}

                steps:
                  1. Component Identification: Identify major system modules.
                  2. Dependency Mapping: Identify cross-story and cross-system dependencies.
                  3. AI Suitability Scoring: Classify tasks by AI leverage potential.
                  4. Base Estimation: Assign senior-level base hours.
                  5. Architecture Output: Produce a blueprint artifact.
