  description: |
                Acts as a Senior Product Owner. Your objective is to scan the BRD and generate a high-level 'Story Map' or 'Index'. 
                
                Constraint: Focus on breadth, not depth. Identify all necessary stories to satisfy the BRD without providing details yet.
            
                input:
                  1. brd_content: {brd_content}
              
                steps:
                  1. Identify all Epics and Feature Sets within the BRD.
                  2. For each feature, generate a Story ID and a "Value Proposition" Title.
                  3. Map each story to a specific high-level goal in the BRD.
