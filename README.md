# # Project NITI: Technical Governance Framework

**AI-Augmented Strategic Project Management & Workspace Automation**

## ## 1. Framework Overview

**Project NITI** (Strategic Neural Integration for Task Implementation) is an autonomous PMO engine. It utilizes a multi-agent orchestration layer via **CrewAI** to transform raw business requirements into a verified, estimated, and fully automated **Trello** workspace.

The framework is specifically engineered to support **junior development teams** by leveraging high-level technical oversight and the productivity gains of **AI-augmented editors** (Cursor, Antigravity, Kiro).

## ## 2. The Virtual Leadership Suite (Roles)

NITI utilizes dynamic personas that adapt their knowledge base to the specific project domain (e.g., Fintech, Healthcare).

| Agent Role | Domain Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| **Context Architect** | Performs domain analysis and specializes the "Council" agents. |
| **Product Owner** | Conducts requirement decomposition and manages value prioritization. |
| **Technical Architect** | Designs system blueprints and evaluates task "AI-suitability." |
| **Technical Lead** | Performs feasibility audits and adjusts hours based on team profiles. |
| **Project Manager** | Owns the timeline, resource allocation, and risk mitigation. |
| **Delivery Manager** | Automates workspace manifestation via the Trello API. |

## ## 3. The NITI Operational Lifecycle

### ### Phase I: Contextualization & Profile Mapping

NITI ingests two primary data sources to set the project baseline:

1. **Business Requirement Document (BRD):** Defines the "What."
2. **Team Profile (Markdown):** Defines the "Who."

The **Context Architect** analyzes these to create a **Team Competency Factor (TCF)**, ensuring the virtual council understands the specific skill gaps and AI tool proficiencies of the actual developers.

### ### Phase II: Augmented Estimation & Analysis

The Council performs a "Consensus Meeting" to generate a **Strategic Project Blueprint**.

#### **The NITI Estimation Formula**

To account for junior developers using modern AI tools, NITI applies a sophisticated multiplier logic:

* **Base Baseline:** Standard hours for a Senior/Expert.
* **Team Multiplier:** Derived from the Markdown profile (e.g., 1.2x for high-match, 2.0x for learning gaps).
* **AI Efficiency Factor:** Discount applied based on task type (e.g., 0.6x for boilerplate, 0.9x for complex logic).

### ### Phase III: Trello Automation & Governance

Once the user approves the **Consensus Report**, the **Delivery Manager** manifests the Trello board with high-fidelity cards containing:

* **Contextual Prompts:** Specific instructions for AI editors like Cursor/Kiro.
* **Technical Guardrails:** Checklists derived from the Architect’s structural design.
* **Capacity-Aware Assignments:** Tasks assigned based on the developer's specific strengths listed in the profile.

## ## 4. Team Profile Specification (Markdown)

To ensure accurate parsing, NITI requires team data in the following standardized format:

```markdown
### Developer: [Name]
- **Role:** [e.g., Junior Frontend]
- **Primary Stack:** [e.g., React, Tailwind]
- **Experience Level:** [e.g., 6 Months]
- **Learning Gaps:** [e.g., State Management, Auth]
- **AI Tooling:** [e.g., Advanced/Proficient with Cursor & Kiro]

```

## ## 5. Performance Benchmarks for AI Tools

NITI classifies tasks into "AI-Optimization Zones" to ensure estimates remain realistic:

1. **High Gain (0.5x - 0.6x):** Scaffolding, boilerplate, unit test generation, CSS styling.
2. **Medium Gain (0.7x - 0.8x):** Refactoring, documentation, simple CRUD logic.
3. **Low Gain (0.9x - 1.0x):** Security protocols, custom business logic, integration debugging.

---

## ## 6. Industry Alignment & Best Practices

* **Agile Governance:** Follows Scrum principles while using hour-based budgeting to provide a safety net for junior teams.
* **Atomic Tasking:** The Technical Lead ensures no Trello card exceeds 8 hours, forcing high granularity.
* **Definition of Done (DoD):** Every card includes a mandatory audit step to verify AI-generated code against the Architect's design.
